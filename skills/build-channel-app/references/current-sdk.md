## Source priority

1. Public package exports and types.
2. Extension schemas and interfaces.
3. SDK reference and locale guides.
4. Current TypeScript and Go tutorial repositories.
5. Older developers.channel.io App articles for product context and wire-level background.

## Current defaults

- AppStore base URL: `https://app-store.channel.io`
- Function route: `PUT /functions/:version`
- Function Endpoint setting: the `/functions` root
- WAM Endpoint setting: the root below which each WAM name is served
- Registration: `registerExtension` plus metadata functions
- TypeScript function context type: `Context`
- Server token manager scopes: app and channel

## Concept boundaries

- A Function is one typed server operation. The request envelope contains `method`, `params`, and `context`; handlers normally receive validated context and params.
- A TypeScript Extension is an official named, system-versioned capability declared with `@Extension`. Its relative `@Func` names are exposed as `extension.{extensionName}.{relativeName}`.
- Register app-specific behavior as standalone `@Func` methods without `@Extension`. In Go, use `appsdk.Register` or `appsdk.MustRegister`.
- AppStore discovers names and schemas through `extension.core.function.getFunctions`; the SDK owns the versioned route and dispatch.
- WAM is client UI loaded from `${WAM_ENDPOINT}/${name}`. It uses the host bridge through `@channel.io/app-sdk-wam` and must not contain server secrets.

## Authentication boundaries

- Verify inbound Function requests with the raw-body HMAC `x-signature` and Signing Key.
- Use `TokenManager` for server-side app/channel tokens; use shared cache storage across multiple replicas.
- Manager/user native authorization belongs to the Channel WAM runtime and is not minted by the server token manager.
- `ctx.authToken` is a connected external OAuth provider token.
- API keys, `client_credentials`, and per-shop secrets belong in config-backed credentials, not OAuth Authorization Code flows.

## Managed builder contract

- Generated TypeScript apps should use `ChannelAppModule` and lock the resolved SDK version before release.
- The generated runtime path is `/functions/v1`; the AppStore Function Endpoint remains the `/functions` root.
- A managed platform can own deploy-time endpoint synchronization and extension registration, so respect its provided `APP_STORE_URL` and registration settings.
- Do not copy builder-only preview calls into a WAM that runs in the Channel client; use the public WAM SDK hooks.

## Feature choice

- TypeScript: use `ChannelAppModule`, decorators or the simple API, `TokenManager`, `NativeFunctionClient`, and WAM hooks.
- Go: use `appsdk.App`, extension builders, `server` or `server/gin`, and `native.TokenManager`.
- Check `docs/reference/go-feature-parity.md` before using a TypeScript native convenience API in Go.

# Extension Guide

This folder explains the extension contracts that the SDK can implement today.
All examples below assume the current public packages:

- `@channel.io/app-sdk-server`
- `@channel.io/app-sdk-wam`

## Current Recommendation

Use `@Extension`, `@Func`, and schema decorators from `@channel.io/app-sdk-server`.
Older factory examples are not part of the current public exports.

## Notes

- Command, widget, custom tab, hook, and polling are metadata-driven. AppStore reads their metadata functions during registration.
- Mail relay is relay-driven at runtime. TypeScript `0.17.2` requires a standalone full-name Function plus explicit registration because `mailRelay` is not accepted by `@Extension`.
- OAuth is an auth extension. API key is legacy/deprecated for new apps; prefer Config for setup UI, stored credentials, validation, and app-specific configuration.
- DataSource metadata is JSON-RPC; query execution is handled by the app server datasource gRPC endpoint. PostgreSQL, BigQuery, and Arrow packages are optional peer dependencies and are loaded only by the runner that uses them.
- Messaging has decorator routing, schemas, and interfaces, but AppStore still coordinates several
  subfamily registrations and native claims separately. Treat it as an advanced integration and do
  not assume generic registration alone completes rollout.
- Notebook apps expose app-managed notebook definitions. AppStore owns extension registration and native proxying; Channel owns notebook storage, revisioning, sync, and UI.

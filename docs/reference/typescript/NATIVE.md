# Native Functions

Native Functions are Channel-provided Functions.
A regular Function is an RPC exposed by an app server, while a Native Function is an RPC an app calls through AppStore to read or mutate Channel resources.

## Calling Native Functions

Native Functions are called through `PUT /general/v1/native/functions`.
The request body uses the same shape as regular Function calls.

```json
{
  "method": "writeUserChatMessage",
  "params": {}
}
```

Most Native Functions require `x-access-token`. Issue the token with `issueToken` or `TokenManager`, and pass the current access token at call time.

Successful responses include `result`; failed responses include `error`.

## SDK Structure

Native Function contracts are maintained as core types.

- Type map: `packages/core/src/types/native.ts`
- Root export: `packages/core/src/types/index.ts` -> `@channel.io/app-sdk-core`
- Transport client: `packages/server/src/native/client.ts`

Check `NativeFunctionTypeMap` in `packages/core/src/types/native.ts` for the modeled Native Functions.

`NativeFunctionClient` is transport-only. It does not run zod parsing at runtime; TypeScript infers params/result from the method string literal.

```ts
const result = await client.callNativeFunctionWithToken(
  "findOrCreateUserChatByMedium",
  params,
  accessToken,
);
```

AppDataTable functions are also modeled in the type map and schema exports. Use
an app-scoped token for all AppDataTable native functions. Functions that read
or write tenant data still require `channelId` as an input field, but AppStore
authorizes them against the caller app's `appId`; `channelId` is not a channel
RBAC scope requirement for these functions. The SDK only accepts logical `appId`,
`channelId`, `tableName`, schema columns, and rows; BigQuery project/dataset
names stay an AppStore/Core concern.

```ts
import { getNativeFunctionSchemas } from "@channel.io/app-sdk-server";

const schemas = getNativeFunctionSchemas();
```

## Typed Channel operations

For server-side Channel operations, obtain a channel token and create the typed proxy:

```ts
const token = await tokenManager.getChannelToken({ channelId });
const api = nativeClient.createProxyApi(token.accessToken);

await api.writeGroupMessage({
  channelId,
  groupId,
  dto: { plainText: "Hello", botName: "ExampleBot" },
});
```

Prefer a typed proxy method when one exists. Use `callNativeFunctionWithToken()` only for a public
Native Function already represented by your app's reviewed contract.

## Contract source

The public SDK exports are the source of truth for supported TypeScript calls. Check
`NativeFunctionTypeMap`, `NativeFunctionClient`, and `ProxyApi` through the installed package's
types. Keep request and response models limited to that public surface, use camelCase JSON fields,
and treat intentionally open result models as opaque. The shared envelope is summarized in the
[cross-language protocol](../protocol.md).
